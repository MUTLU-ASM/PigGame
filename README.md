Pig Game is a fun and straightforward game that you can play with friends or family using a single die. The objective of the game is typically to be the first player to reach a certain score, often 100 points. Here are the basic rules for the Pig Game:

## Gameplay:

1. The game is typically played between two players.
2. Each player's turn consists of the following steps:
- a. Roll the die.
- b. Record the number rolled.
- c. The player can choose to either:  
      - "Hold" and add the recorded points to their overall score, ending their turn.  
      - Continue rolling the die to accumulate more points on that turn.
3. If a player rolls a 1, their turn ends immediately, and they don't score any points for that turn. It's the other player's turn.
4. The first player to reach or exceed the agreed-upon target score, usually 100 points, wins the game.

## Scoring:

* The points recorded in each turn are added to the player's current turn score.
* If a player rolls a 1, their turn score is reset to 0, and they lose the points they accumulated in that turn.
* The player can choose to "hold" at any point, and their turn score is added to their overall score.
* The first player to reach or exceed the target score wins.

The Pig Game is known for its risk-reward aspect, where players must decide whether to keep rolling to accumulate more points or hold to secure their current score and avoid the risk of rolling a 1.
